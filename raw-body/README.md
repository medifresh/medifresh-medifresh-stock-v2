Gets the entire buffer of a stream either as a `Buffer` or a string.
Validates the stream's length against an expected length and maximum limit.
Ideal for parsing request bodies.

## Install

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```sh
$ npm install raw-body
```

### TypeScript

This module includes a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
declaration file to enable auto complete in compatible editors and type
information for TypeScript projects. This module depends on the Node.js
types, so install `@types/node`:

```sh
$ npm install @types/node
```

## API

```js
var getRawBody = require('raw-body')
```

### getRawBody(stream, [options], [callback])

**Returns a promise if no callback specified and global `Promise` exists.**

Options:

- `length` - The length of the stream.
  If the contents of the stream do not add up to this length,
  an `400` error code is returned.
- `limit` - The byte limit of the body.
  This is the number of bytes or any string format supported by
  [bytes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bytes),
  for example `1000`, `'500kb'` or `'3mb'`.
  If the body ends up being larger than this limit,
  a `413` error code is returned.
- `encoding` - The encoding to use to decode the body into a string.
  By default, a `Buffer` instance will be returned when no encoding is specified.
  Most likely, you want `utf-8`, so setting `encoding` to `true` will decode as `utf-8`.
  You can use any type of encoding supported by [iconv-lite](https://www.npmjs.org/package/iconv-lite#readme).

You can also pass a string in place of options to just specify the encoding.

If an error occurs, the stream will be paused, everything unpiped,
and you are responsible for correctly disposing the stream.
For HTTP requests, you may need to finish consuming the stream if
you want to keep the socket open for future requests. For streams
that use file descriptors, you should `stream.destroy()` or
`stream.close()` to prevent leaks.

## Errors

This module creates errors depending on the error condition during reading.
The error may be an error from the underlying Node.js implementation, but is
otherwise an error created by this module, which has the following attributes:

  * `limit` - the limit in bytes
  * `length` and `expected` - the expected length of the stream
  * `received` - the received bytes
  * `encoding` - the invalid encoding
  * `status` and `statusCode` - the corresponding status code for the error
  * `type` - the error type

### Types

The errors from this module have a `type` property which allows for the programmatic
deter
